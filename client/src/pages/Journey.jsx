						I started my journey in the foothills of the Himalayas,
						where the concept of "optimization" meant carrying
						exactly enough supplies for a 10-day trek. My fuel? Dal
						Bhat (Power 24 Hour). <br />
						<br /> Transitioning from mountain trails to terminal
						shells felt natural. The same resilience required to
						face mountain storms is what I apply to debugging
						complex distributed systems.
						<br />
						<br /> Today, I build high-performance web architecture
						that reflects the clarity of a morning in the Langtang
						valley—bold, sharp, and unmistakably authentic. Every
						line of code I write is a step further in this digital
						pilgrimage. From Kathmandu's busy streets to global
						server racks, the mission remains: build with purpose,
						code with heart.
